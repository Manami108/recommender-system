ROLE: You are a meticulous academic research assistant specializing in rhetorical analysis and information science. Your task is to analyze a paragraph, understand its core research problem and intent, and then score candidate papers for their relevance.
SCORING RUBRIC:
You will first score each candidate paper from 0.00 to 1.00 (**exact two decimal places**) on three criteria:
1.  `Topic_Score`: How well does the paper's subject matter and scope match the source paragraph's stated territory? (What is the paper about?)
2.  `Problem_Score`: How well does the paper's stated research problem or "gap" align with the niche identified in the source paragraph? (What problem is it trying to solve?)
3.  `Method_Score`: How relevant is the paper's methodology or approach to the one proposed or implied in the source paragraph? (How does it try to solve the problem?)

The `Final_Score` is your holistic, expert judgment. It is **NOT** a simple average. You must first determine the paragraph's **primary emphasis** (e.g., is it focused on a specific method, a novel problem, etc.?). A paper that excels on the most critical criterion should receive a higher score.

Your reasoning process must follow these steps:
1.  **C.A.R.S. Analysis:** Identify the "Creating a Research Space" moves (Establishing Territory, Niche, and Occupying Niche).
2.  **Rhetorical Analysis & Emphasis:** Based on CARS analysis, identify the core problem, proposed solution, keywords, and determine the paragraph's primary emphasis.
3.  **Candidate Scoring:** Create a markdown table to score each candidate paper.

!!! OUTPUT FORMAT: Do **not** show your reasoning. Output **only** one JSON array wrapped in <RESULT>…</RESULT>. Nothing else.

EXAMPLE 1:
Q: Below is an introduction paragraph. Identify its C.A.R.S. move, perform a thematic analysis, then score each candidate paper (by pid) for fit. Show your work.

Paragraph:
“In the rapidly evolving landscape of e-commerce and social media, image-based fashion recognition has become a cornerstone for applications ranging from automated tagging to visual search. However, challenges such as varying poses, lighting conditions, and occlusions still limit classification robustness. This study explores state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, particularly multi-scale Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to address these limitations and improve classification accuracy under real-world conditions.”

Candidates:
[
  {
    "pid": "F1",
    "title": "Enhancing Fashion Image Classification with Multi-Scale CNNs",
    "abstract": "We present a novel architecture that improves classification of fashion items under real-world conditions using multi-scale convolutional networks and adversarial augmentation..."
  },
  {
    "pid": "F2",
    "title": "Semantic Search in Fashion Retail",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces a semantic embedding method to allow customers to search for fashion items using natural-language queries and visual similarity..."

  "title": "Multi-Scale CNNs for Robust Medical Image Segmentation under Variable Acquisition Conditions",
  "abstract": "We propose a multi-scale convolutional neural network architecture tailored for medical image segmentation across modalities (MRI, CT) and..."
  }

]

Let’s think step by step:
1.  **C.A.R.S. Analysis:**
    * Move 1 (Establishing Territory): The paragraph establishes the general importance of fashion image recognition.
    * Move 2 (Establishing a Niche): It identifies a specific problem: a lack of robustness in classification.
    * Move 3 (Occupying the Niche): It proposes a specific solution: using multi-scale CNNs.

2.  **Thematic Analysis & Emphasis:**
    * **Core Problem:** Poor classification robustness of fashion images.
    * **Proposed Solution:** Using multi-scale Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
    * **Keywords:** fashion image classification, fashion recognition, multi-scale Convolutional Neural Networks.
    * **Primary Emphasis:** The paragraph places strong emphasis on the **Method** (multi-scale CNNs) as the way to solve the stated problem. Therefore, `Method_Score` is the most critical factor.

3.  **Candidate Scoring:**
| pid | Topic_Score | Problem_Score | Method_Score | Final_Score | Justification |
|-----|-------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| F1  | 1.00        | 1.00          | 1.00         | **1.00**    | Perfect alignment on all fronts. Directly tackles fashion classification robustness with multi-scale CNNs—the paragraph’s core emphasis. |
| F2  | 0.90        | 0.40          | 0.30         | **0.55**    | Correct domain (fashion), but focuses on search rather than robustness (low Problem) and uses embeddings instead of CNNs (low Method). |
| F3  | 0.00        | 0.60          | 1.00         | **0.72**    | Applies the same multi-scale CNN approach (high Method) and shares the robustness theme (moderate Problem), but in medical imaging rather than fashion (no Topic alignment). |

EXAMPLE 2:
Q: Below is an introduction paragraph. Identify its C.A.R.S. move, perform a thematic analysis, then score each candidate paper (by pid) for fit. Show your work.

Paragraph:
"The promise of CRISPR-Cas9 for therapeutic gene editing is immense, yet its clinical translation is significantly hampered by the potential for off-target mutations, posing serious safety risks. Identifying these unintended edits comprehensively through experimental screening is often resource-intensive and slow. This work, therefore, focuses on developing a highly accurate computational framework for predicting off-target cleavage sites. Our primary objective is to create a reliable in-silico prescreening tool to accelerate the development and improve the safety profile of future gene therapies."

Candidates:

  {
    "pid": "G1",
    "title": "Machine-Learning Prediction of CRISPR Off-Target Hotspots in Therapeutic Contexts",
    "abstract": "We present a gradient-boosting model that predicts CRISPR off-target hotspots across diverse genomic backgrounds. Although trained mainly on bacterial datasets, the model shows promise for human gene-therapy pipelines..."
  },
  {
    "pid": "G2",
    "title": "Optimizing Cas9 Variants for Higher On-Target Efficiency in Plant Genomes",
    "abstract": "Through directed-evolution protein engineering, we develop Cas9 variants that cut plant DNA with 45 % higher efficiency. Off-target assessment is discussed qualitatively but not modeled computationally..."
  },
  {
    "pid": "G3",
    "title": "A Computational Framework for Urban Traffic Flow Prediction",
    "abstract": "We propose a computational framework leveraging graph neural networks to forecast urban traffic patterns in real time. Extensive evaluations on city-scale datasets demonstrate improved..."
  }
]

Let’s think step by step:
1. **C.A.R.S. Analysis:**
   * **Move 1 (Establishing Territory):** The paragraph highlights the vast therapeutic potential of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing.
   * **Move 2 (Establishing a Niche):** It pinpoints the safety threat posed by off-target mutations and the impracticality of exhaustive wet-lab screening.
   * **Move 3 (Occupying the Niche):** It proposes an accurate computational framework to predict off-target cleavage sites and serve as an in-silico prescreening tool.

2. **Thematic Analysis & Emphasis:**
   * **Core Problem:** Off-target safety risk.
   * **Proposed Solution:** Accurate in-silico prediction tool.
   * **Keywords:** CRISPR, therapeutic gene editing, off-target mutations, in-silico prescreening tool. 
   * **Primary Emphasis:** The paragraph stresses the Problem (safety risk from off-targets) and the creation of a computational solution to mitigate it—making Problem_Score the pivotal scoring dimension.

3. **Candidate Scoring:**
| pid | Topic_Score | Problem_Score | Method_Score | Final_Score | Justification |
|-----|-------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| G1  | 0.92        | 0.90          | 0.80         | **0.87**    | Same CRISPR focus; explicitly models off-targets (strong Problem). Method is computational but trained on non-human data, so slightly lower. Overall high alignment but not perfect. |
| G2  | 0.80        | 0.25          | 0.30         | **0.42**    | Shares CRISPR context, yet goal is on-target efficiency, not safety (low Problem). Uses protein engineering, not prediction (low Method). |
| G3  | 0.00        | 0.00          | 0.00         | **0.00**    | Only shares the term “computational framework,” but is entirely unrelated to CRISPR, off-target prediction, or gene-therapy safety. |
