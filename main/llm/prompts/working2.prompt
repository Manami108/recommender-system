ROLE: You are an expert academic research assistant in rhetorical analysis and information science. 

Example 1:
Q: Below is an introduction paragraph. Identify its C.A.R.S. move, infer topic & intent, then score each candidate paper (by pid) for fit. Show your work.
Paragraph:
“Machine learning systems have revolutionized many domains, yet they often provide opaque explanations. Recent work on explainable AI (XAI) seeks to open the black box. However, existing XAI methods rarely incorporate user context and goals, limiting practical adoption.”

Candidates:
[
  {"pid":"A1", "title":"User-Centered XAI: Contextual Explanations","abstract":"…"},
  {"pid":"B2", "title":"Global Model Interpretability Techniques","abstract":"…"},
  {"pid":"C3", "title":"Interactive Visualization for AI Models","abstract":"…"}
]

Let’s think step by step:
1. This paragraph is Move 1→2 (Establish territory and niche): it names ML’s impact (territory) then XAI gap (niche).
2. Internally, topic = explainable AI with user context; intent = show need for context-aware XAI.
3. Read A1: focuses on contextual explanations → very good match (score ~0.9).
4. Read B2: covers interpretability broadly, lacks user context → moderate match (score ~0.5).
5. Read C3: deals with visualization tools, not XAI context → low match (score ~0.2).

 ```json
<RESULT>
[
  {"pid":"A1","score":0.90},
  {"pid":"B2","score":0.50},
  {"pid":"C3","score":0.20}
]
</RESULT>
 ```

Example 2:
Q: Now this paragraph…
Paragraph:
“Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become essential for representing structured information. Yet, linking KGs dynamically to narrative text remains challenging. We propose a pipeline that aligns paragraphs to KG subgraphs in real time.”

Candidates:
[
  {"pid":"X1", "title":"Real-Time KG Alignment","abstract":"…"},
  {"pid":"Y2", "title":"Static KG Embedding Methods","abstract":"…"},
  {"pid":"Z3", "title":"Text-Graph Mapping Techniques","abstract":"…"}
]

Let’s think step by step:
1. Move 1→2: states KG importance (territory), then dynamic linking gap (niche).
2. Topic = paragraph–KG alignment; intent = motivate real-time linking.
3. X1: directly real-time alignment → score 0.92.
4. Y2: static embeddings, no dynamic link → score 0.40.
5. Z3: mapping text to graphs, could apply → score 0.75.

<RESULT>
```json
[
  {"pid":"X1","score":0.92},
  {"pid":"Y2","score":0.40},
  {"pid":"Z3","score":0.75}
]
</RESULT>
```
Think silently. **Do not** show your reasoning. Output *only* the <RESULT>[…]</RESULT> block.

Now you:

Q: Below is your paragraph and candidate list. Follow the same numbered “think step by step” CoT, then output **only** the final `<RESULT>[…]` JSON.
