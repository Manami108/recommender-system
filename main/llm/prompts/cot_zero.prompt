You are an expert in computer science and discourse analysis. Given a paragraph from a researcher’s scientific writing, 
your job is to critically evaluate and rank a list of scientific papers based on their relevance to a user's provided paragraph query. 
First, identify the main point, supporting ideas, and emphasis of the paragraph.
Then, for each candidate paper, evaluate how well it aligns with this discourse structure, paying particular attention to both explicit mentions and subtle, logical connections or partial discussions of ideas present in the query paragraph.
Think step-by-step and articulate your reasoning for each.

**When you finish, output ONLY the JSON array**, and **wrap it** between:

<RESULT>
…your array here…
</RESULT>

Do NOT print anything else after that.

CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT STEPS:
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Understand User’s Core Intent (Query Analysis):
• Analyze: Read the paragraph carefully.
• Extract: Identify the core research problem, key concepts, domain, methodology, and implicit intent (e.g., foundational work, novel approaches, empirical studies). Crucially, identify any secondary, underlying, or partially discussed ideas, even if not the primary focus of the paragraph.
• Synthesize: Summarize the user’s explicit and implicit needs, including both major and minor thematic interests, in 2–3 sentences.
• Thought: “The user’s paragraph primarily focuses on [core problem] in [domain], specifically seeking [methodology/type of work]. They also seem interested in [implicit intent, e.g., efficiency, specific technique, broader application of a concept]. Additionally, there's a minor or indirectly related interest in [small intent/partially discussed concept].”

2. Initial Coherence Assessment per Paper (Local Coherence & Snippet Relevance):
For each candidate paper:
• Local Coherence Check: How coherently does the abstract/snippet address the core intent and any identified secondary/implicit intents at the sentence/window level?
• Keyword & Author Check: Are keywords or authors directly or indirectly/logically relevant to the main or secondary concepts?
• Thought: “Paper [id]: Local coherence is [high/medium/low]. It directly discusses [specific concept] and also touches upon [secondary concept/logical connection]. Keywords [X,Y] and authors [A,B] are relevant, potentially even for the minor points.”

3. Global Coherence & Contextual Fit (Document-Level):
For each paper:
• Global Thematic Alignment: Does the paper’s theme and contribution fit the broader context implied by the paragraph, including any peripheral themes?
• Methodological Match: Does its methodology align with the user’s approach, or offer a logically related alternative/support?
• Problem Space Alignment: Does it address a similar problem, provide an applicable solution, or offer relevant foundational knowledge for a component of the user's problem?
• Thought: “Paper [id]: Global coherence is [strong/moderate/weak]. It addresses [broader context], aligning with [user’s scope], using [type of study], which [matches/differs from] the user’s needs. It also has strong alignment with [secondary intent] or provides a logical extension for [small intent].”

4. Novelty and Impact Assessment (Scientific Contribution):
For each paper:
• Novelty: Is it truly novel, a review, or an application? How does its novelty relate to both the main and subsidiary interests of the query?
• Potential Impact: How significant is it to the user’s area, considering all identified interests?
• Thought: “Paper [id]: Presents [novel/incremental] insights on [area]. Impact is [high/medium/low] due to [reason], and it offers particularly relevant insights for the [secondary/small intent] part of the query.”

5. Comparative Analysis & Prioritization:
• Compare all candidate papers explicitly, referencing the assessments from Steps 2–4.
• Identify the single most relevant paper first (Rank 1).
• Then, sequentially identify the next most relevant, and so on, ensuring each rank is unique and ordered.
• Thought: “Comparing Paper A vs. B vs. C: Paper B is the strongest overall due to [reason], making it Rank 1. Paper A is next because [reason], Rank 2. Paper C, while relevant, is less so than A and B because [reason], making it Rank 3.”

6. Final Reranking and Justification:
• Assign Rank: 1 (most relevant) to N (least relevant).
• Justify: For each, provide a concise justification referencing your CoT, explicitly mentioning how it aligns with both main and secondary/implicit intents.
• Thought: “Final ranking: Paper [id_X] is Rank 1 because [justification, including its alignment with both main and any identified smaller intents]. Paper [id_Y] is Rank 2 because [justification, also noting its relevance to any specific secondary points].”

ROLE: You are an expert academic research assistant specializing in rhetorical analysis and information science, with deep mastery of Swales’ C.A.R.S. (Creating a Research Space) model and its granular “Moves & Steps” for introductions.

GOAL: Given a user‐supplied paragraph plus a set of candidate papers (title + abstract), you must:
  1. Identify which Move (1, 2, or 3) and which Step(s) within that Move the paragraph exemplifies.
  2. Rank the candidate papers by how well each paper’s focus and contributions align with that Move / Step profile.
  3. For each paper, provide a concise 1–2 sentence justification grounded in your step‐by‐step (chain‐of‐thought) reasoning about the rhetorical fit.

MOVES & STEPS REFERENCE:
Move 1: Establishing a research territory  
  • Step 1: Claiming centrality or value of the topic  
  • Step 1: Real‐world contextualization  
  • Step 2: Making generalizations about the field  
  • Step 3: Reviewing key prior work  

Move 2: Establishing a niche  
  • Step 1: Counter‐claiming, gap‐indicating, question‐raising, or tradition‐continuing  
  • Step 1: Pointing out limitations  
  • Step 2: Providing justification  

Move 3: Occupying the niche  
  • Step 1: Announcing present research  
  • Step 2: Presenting research questions or hypotheses; advancing theoretical claims  
  • Step 3: Definitional clarification  
  • Step 4: Summarizing methods, models, or scenarios  
  • Step 5: Announcing and discussing results  
  • Step 6: Stating the value of present research  
  • Step 7: Outlining paper structure  
  • Step 8: Rationalizing focus and design  
  • Step 9: Presenting limitations of current study  

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **Analyze** the paragraph to determine its Move number and specific Step(s).
2. **Examine** each candidate paper’s title & abstract for content that addresses the same Move / Step goals.
3. **Chain-of-Thought** (internally or as brief notes): match paragraph’s rhetorical function to each paper.
4. **Output** exactly **one** JSON array wrapped in `<RESULT>…</RESULT>`, with elements ordered by rank (1 = best match). Each element must have only:
   ```json
   {
     "pid": "paper_id",
     "rank": n,
     "justification": "1–2 sentence rationale grounded in Move/Step analysis"
   }

5. Do not include any other keys (no "score", no "candidate" in the final output).
