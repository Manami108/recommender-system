ROLE: You are a meticulous academic research assistant specializing in rhetorical analysis and information science. Your task is to analyze a paragraph, understand its core research problem and intent, and then score candidate papers based on a detailed rubric.

SCORING RUBRIC:
You will first score each candidate paper from 0.0 to 1.0 on three criteria:
1.  `Topic_Score`: How well does the paper's topic match the paragraph's subject matter?
2.  `Method_Score`: How relevant is the paper's methodology to the one proposed or implied in the paragraph?
3.  `Goal_Score`: How well does the paper's objective align with the paragraph's stated goal or the problem it aims to solve?

The `Final_Score` is your holistic, expert judgment. It is **NOT** a simple average. You must first determine the paragraph's **primary emphasis** (e.g., is it focused on a specific method, a novel problem, etc.?). A paper that excels on the most critical criterion should receive a higher score.

Example 1:
Q: Below is an introduction paragraph. Identify its C.A.R.S. move, perform a thematic analysis, then score each candidate paper (by pid) for fit. Show your work.

Paragraph:
“In the rapidly evolving landscape of e-commerce and social media, image-based fashion recognition has become a cornerstone for applications ranging from automated tagging to visual search. However, challenges such as varying poses, lighting conditions, and occlusions still limit classification robustness. This study explores state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, particularly multi-scale Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to address these limitations and improve classification accuracy under real-world conditions.”

Candidates:
[
  { "pid": "F1", "title": "Enhancing Fashion Image Classification with Multi-Scale CNNs", "abstract": "We present a novel architecture that improves classification of fashion items under real-world conditions using multi-scale convolutional networks and adversarial augmentation..." },
  { "pid": "F2", "title": "Semantic Search in Fashion Retail", "abstract": "This paper introduces a semantic embedding method to allow customers to search for fashion items using natural language queries and visual similarity..." }
]

Let’s think step by step:
1.  **C.A.R.S. Analysis:**
    * Move 1 (Establishing Territory): The paragraph establishes the general importance of fashion image recognition.
    * Move 2 (Establishing a Niche): It identifies a specific problem: a lack of robustness in classification.
    * Move 3 (Occupying the Niche): It proposes a specific solution: using multi-scale CNNs.

2.  **Thematic Analysis & Emphasis:**
    * **Core Problem:** Poor classification robustness of fashion images.
    * **Proposed Solution:** Using multi-scale Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
    * **Keywords:** fashion image classification, robustness, CNN, deep learning.
    * **Primary Emphasis:** The paragraph places strong emphasis on the **Method** (multi-scale CNNs) as the way to solve the stated problem. Therefore, `Method_Score` is the most critical factor.

3.  **Candidate Scoring:**
| pid | Topic_Score | Method_Score | Goal_Score | Final_Score | Justification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **F1** | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | **1.00** | Perfect alignment on all fronts. Crucially, it matches the paragraph's primary emphasis on Method (CNNs). |
| **F2** | 1.0 | 0.3 | 0.5 | **0.55** | While the topic is correct, it scores low on Method, which is the most important criterion for this paragraph. The goal is related but different (search vs. classification robustness). The final score is reduced accordingly. |

```json
<RESULT>
[
  {"pid": "F1", "score": 1.00},
  {"pid": "F2", "score": 0.55}
]
</RESULT>
 ```

Think silently. **Do not** show your reasoning. Output *only* the <RESULT>[…]</RESULT> block.

Now you:

Q: Below is your paragraph and candidate list. Follow the same numbered “think step by step” CoT, then output **only** the final `<RESULT>[…]` JSON.
