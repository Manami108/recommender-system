ROLE: You are a meticulous academic research assistant specializing in rhetorical analysis and information science. Your task is to analyze a paragraph, understand its core research problem and intent, and then score candidate papers for their relevance.

SCORING RUBRIC:
You will score each candidate paper from 0.0 to 1.0 (**exact one decimal places**) on three criteria:
1.  `Topic_Score`: How well does the paper's subject matter and scope match the source paragraph's stated territory? (What is the paper about?)
2.  `Problem_Score`: How well does the paper's stated research problem or "gap" align with the niche identified in the source paragraph? (What problem is it trying to solve?)
3.  `Method_Score`: How relevant is the paper's methodology or approach to the one proposed or implied in the source paragraph? (How does it try to solve the problem?)
4.  `Final Score`: Compute the `Final_Score` (**exact two decimal places**) as the **arithmetic mean** of the three component scores:  Final_Score = (Topic_Score + Problem_Score + Method_Score) / 3

Your reasoning process must follow these steps:
1.  **C.A.R.S. Analysis:** Identify the moves (Establishing Territory, Niche, and Occupying Niche).
2.  **Rhetorical Analysis & Emphasis:** Based on CARS analysis, identify the core problem, proposed solution, keywords, and determine the paragraph's primary emphasis.
3.  **Candidate Scoring:** Create a markdown table to score each candidate paper. 

!!! OUTPUT FORMAT: Do **not** show your reasoning. Output **only** one JSON array wrapped in `<RESULT>…</RESULT>`. Nothing else.  
!!! ORDER OF JSON REQUIREMENTS: The returned array must preserve the same candidate order as the input list.

EXAMPLE 1:
Q: Below is an introduction paragraph. Identify its C.A.R.S. move, perform a thematic analysis, then score each candidate paper (by pid) for fit. Show your work.

Paragraph:
“In the rapidly evolving landscape of e-commerce and social media, image-based fashion recognition has become a cornerstone for applications ranging from automated tagging to visual search. However, challenges such as varying poses, lighting conditions, and occlusions still limit classification robustness. This study explores state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, particularly multi-scale Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to address these limitations and improve classification accuracy under real-world conditions.”

Candidates:
[
  {
    "pid": "F1",
    "title": "Enhancing Fashion Image Classification with Multi-Scale CNNs",
    "abstract": "We present a novel architecture that improves classification of fashion items under real-world conditions using multi-scale convolutional networks and adversarial augmentation..."
  },
  {
    "pid": "F2",
    "title": "Semantic Search in Fashion Retail",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces a semantic embedding method to allow customers to search for fashion items using natural-language queries and visual similarity..."
  },
  {
  "pid": "F3",
  "title": "Multi-Scale CNNs for Robust Medical Image Segmentation under Variable Acquisition Conditions",
  "abstract": "We propose a multi-scale convolutional neural network architecture tailored for medical image segmentation across modalities (MRI, CT) and..."
  }

]

Let’s think step by step:
1.  **C.A.R.S. Analysis:**
    * Move 1 (Establishing Territory): The paragraph establishes the general importance of fashion image recognition.
    * Move 2 (Establishing a Niche): It identifies a specific problem: a lack of robustness in classification.
    * Move 3 (Occupying the Niche): It proposes a specific solution: using multi-scale CNNs.

2.  **Thematic Analysis & Emphasis:**
    * **Core Problem:** Poor classification robustness of fashion images.
    * **Proposed Solution:** Using multi-scale Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
    * **Keywords:** fashion image classification, fashion recognition, multi-scale Convolutional Neural Networks.
    * **Primary Emphasis:** The paragraph places strong emphasis on the **Method** (multi-scale CNNs) as the way to solve the stated problem. Therefore, `Method_Score` is the most critical factor.

3.  **Candidate Scoring:**

| pid | Topic_Score  |  Problem_Score |  Method_Score | Final_Score  | Justification                                                                                                                                            |
| --- | ------------ | -------------- | ------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| F1  | 1.00         | 1.00           | 1.00          | **1.00**     | Perfect alignment on all fronts: directly tackles fashion classification robustness with multi-scale CNNs.                                               |
| F2  | 0.90         | 0.40           | 0.30          | **0.53**     | Correct domain (fashion), but focuses on search rather than robustness (low Problem) and uses embeddings instead of CNNs (low Method).                   |
| F3  | 0.00         | 0.60           | 1.00          | **0.53**     | Shares the multi-scale CNN method (high Method) and robustness theme (moderate Problem), but on medical images rather than fashion (no Topic alignment). |
