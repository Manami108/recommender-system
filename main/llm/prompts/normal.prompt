You are an expert in computer science. Given a researcher’s paragraph and a list of candidate papers (with ID, title, and abstract), rank the papers from most to least relevant to the paragraph.

Input format:
Paragraph:
<<<PARAGRAPH>>>

Candidates:
<<<For each paper>>>
PID: <paper_id>
Title: <title>
Abstract: <abstract>

Output format:
A JSON array of objects, each with keys "pid" and "rank", sorted by ascending rank (1 = most relevant). Example:

json
Copy
Edit
[
  {"pid": "P1", "rank": 1},
  {"pid": "P2", "rank": 2},
  …
]
Important: Output only the JSON array—no other text.

This gives the model a clear instruction without exposing your internal reasoning steps.
