2968101397,Cascade embedding model for knowledge graph inference and retrieval,"Abstract   Knowledge graphs are widely used in retrieval systems, question answering systems (QA), hypothesis generation systems, etc. Representation learning provides a way to mine knowledge graphs to detect missing relations; and translation-based embedding models are a popular form of representation model. Shortcomings of translation-based models however, limits their practicability as knowledge completion algorithms. The proposed model helps to address some of these shortcomings.  The similarity between graph structural features of two entities was found to be correlated to the relations of those entities. This correlation can help to solve the problem caused by unbalanced relations and reciprocal relations. We used Node2vec, a graph embedding algorithm, to represent information related to an entityu0027s graph structure, and we introduce a cascade model to incorporate graph embedding with knowledge embedding into a unified framework. The cascade model first refines feature representation in the first two stages (Local Optimization Stage), and then uses backward propagation to optimize parameters of all the stages (Global Optimization Stage). This helps to enhance the knowledge representation of existing translation-based algorithms by taking into account both semantic features and graph features and fusing them to extract more useful information. Besides, different cascade structures are designed to find the optimal solution to the problem of knowledge inference and retrieval.  The proposed model was verified using three mainstream knowledge graphs: WIN18, FB15K and BioChem. Experimental results were validated using the hit@10 rate entity prediction task. The proposed model performed better than TransE, giving an average improvement of 2.7% on WN18, 2.3% on FB15k and 28% on BioChem. Improvements were particularly marked where there were problems with unbalanced relations and reciprocal relations. Furthermore, the stepwise-cascade structure is proved to be more effective and significantly outperforms other baselines.",1
2788527657,Temporal-difference Learning with Sampling Baseline for Image Captioning,"The existing methods for image captioning usually train the language model under the cross entropy loss, which results in the exposure bias and inconsistency of evaluation metric. Recent research has shown these two issues can be well addressed by policy gradient method in reinforcement learning domain attributable to its unique capability of directly optimizing the discrete and non-differentiable evaluation metric. In this paper, we utilize reinforcement learning method to train the image captioning model. Specifically, we train our image captioning model to maximize the overall reward of the sentences by adopting the temporal-difference (TD) learning method, which takes the correlation between temporally successive actions into account. In this way, we assign different values to different words in one sampled sentence by a discounted coefficient when back-propagating the gradient with the REINFORCE algorithm, enabling the correlation between actions to be learned. Besides, instead of estimating a ""baseline"" to normalize the rewards with another network, we utilize the reward of another Monte-Carlo sample as the ""baseline"" to avoid high variance. We show that our proposed method can improve the quality of generated captions and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark dataset MS COCO in terms of seven evaluation metrics.",1
2973224900,Attention-based context-aware sequential recommendation model,"Abstract   Recurrent neural networks (RNN) based recommendation algorithms have been introduced recently as sequence information plays an increasingly important role when modeling user preferences. However, these methods have numerous limitations: they usually give undue importance to sequential changes and place insufficient emphasis on the correlation between adjacent items; additionally, they typically ignore the impacts of context information. To address these issues, we propose an attention-based context-aware sequential recommendation model using Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), abbreviated as ACA-GRU. First, we consider the impact of context information on recommendations and classify them into four categories, including input context, correlation context, static interest context, and transition context. Then, by redefining the update and reset gate of the GRU unit, we calculate the global sequential state transition of the RNN determined by these contexts, to model the dynamics of user interest. Finally, by leveraging the attention mechanism in the correlation context, the model is able to distinguish the importance of each item in the rating sequence. The impact of outliers that are less informative or less predictive decreases or is ignored. Experimental results indicate that ACA-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art context-aware models as well as sequence recommendation algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model.",1
2611996841,Recognizing semantic correlation in image-text weibo via feature space mapping,"We make effort on recognizing semantic correlation between image and text in image-text weibo.We make an in-depth study of weibo text from language cognitive and computational views and extract textual-linguistic features, from weibo text.We select visual feature space as the unified one and the genetic mapping algorithm is used to transform textual-linguistic and social features into the unified feature space to eliminate the heterogeneity and incomparability of the different types of features. Recent years have witnessed the fast development of social media platforms, such as Twitter, Sina Weibo, and Wechat. Practically, the textual weibos are frequently uploaded with images, namely image-text weibos in this paper. To gain the deep insights into the semantics of the image-text weibos, this paper explores the semantic correlation between the image and text. The semantic correlation recognition approach based on feature space mapping and support vector machine has been developed, due to the heterogeneity and incomparability of image, text, and social multi-source information in image-text weibos. Our model firstly extracts three types of features, namely, textual-linguistic, visual, and social features. It then uses the genetic algorithm to project the features from the different feature spaces to the unified one. At last, the semantic correlation recognition model based on support vector machine is constructed in the unified feature space. The experimental results show that the accuracy of our recognition model for semantic correlation between image and text in image-text weibo, with feature space mapping and support vector machine using the three types of multi-source features, achieves a significant performance compared to the traditional model only based on support vector machine.",1
2976429401,Path-based reasoning approach for knowledge graph completion using CNN-BiLSTM with attention mechanism,"Abstract   Knowledge graphs are valuable resources for building intelligent systems such as question answering or recommendation systems. However, most knowledge graphs are impaired by missing relationships between entities. Embedding methods that translate entities and relations into a low-dimensional space achieve great results, but they only focus on the direct relations between entities and neglect the presence of path relations in graphs. On the contrary, path-based embedding methods consider a single path to make inferences. It also relies on simple recurrent neural networks while highly efficient neural network models are available for processing sequence data. We propose a new approach for knowledge graph completion that combines bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and convolutional neural network modules with an attention mechanism. Given a candidate relation and two entities, we encode paths that connect the entities into a low-dimensional space using a convolutional operation followed by BiLSTM. Then, an attention layer is applied to capture the semantic correlation between a candidate relation and each path between two entities and attentively extract reasoning evidence from the representation of multiple paths to predict whether the entities should be connected by the candidate relation. We extend our model to perform multistep reasoning over path representations in an embedding space. A recurrent neural network is designed to repeatedly interact with an attention module to derive logical inference from the representation of multiple paths. We perform link prediction tasks on several knowledge graphs and show that our method achieves better performance compared with recent state-of-the-art path-reasoning methods.",1

They read the abstracts and decide whether or not it is a related and relevant work. Therefore, this paper presents an approach for linking researchers based on measuring the similarity between the abstracts of their scientific publications in English. Our approach discovers ontological relationships between free text scientific publications using statistical and semantic similarity measures. An evaluation of a gold standard data set is presented, it has shown an average of 0.6399 for Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient.",1
2950359760,Leveraging bridging universities to access international knowledge: Korean universitiesâ€™ R&D internationalization,"Bridging universities are research entities that connect the international research community with their domestic peer universities, referred as bridged universities. In this paper, we study co-authorship networks using international collaborative publication data from Korean universities and investigate the structural relationships between 142 Korean universities and 105 foreign countries. The results reveal the presence of bridging universities at the center of the international Ru0026D networks. Further, we identify a positive relationship between bridged universitiesâ€™ research outcomes and their collaboration intensity with bridging universities. However, a negative correlation is also found between bridged universitiesâ€™ Ru0026D internationalization and their collaboration with bridging universities. Universities, especially in latecomer countries where access to international knowledge is limited, are advised to balance their utilization of bridging universities with contacting global partners directly for their internalization efforts.",1
2222794291,A Visual Embedding for the Unsupervised Extraction of Abstract Semantics,"Vector-space word representations obtained from neural network models have been shown to enable semantic operations based on vector arithmetic. In this paper, we explore the existence of similar information on vector representations of images. For that purpose we define a methodology to obtain large, sparse vector representations of image classes, and generate vectors through the state-of-the-art deep learning architecture GoogLeNet for 20K images obtained from ImageNet. We first evaluate the resultant vector-space semantics through its correlation with WordNet distances, and find vector distances to be strongly correlated with linguistic semantics. We then explore the location of images within the vector space, finding elements close in WordNet to be clustered together, regardless of significant visual variances (e.g. 118 dog types). More surprisingly, we find that the space unsupervisedly separates complex classes without prior knowledge (e.g. living things). Afterwards, we consider vector arithmetics. Although we are unable to obtain meaningful results on this regard, we discuss the various problem we encountered, and how we consider to solve them. Finally, we discuss the impact of our research for cognitive systems, focusing on the role of the architecture being used.",1
2584816862,CSF: Crowdsourcing semantic fusion for heterogeneous media big data in the internet of things,"Abstract   With the rising popularity of social media in the context of environments based on the Internet of things (IoT), semantic information has emerged as an important bridge to connect human intelligence with heterogeneous media big data. As a critical tool to improve media big data retrieval, semantic fusion encounters a number of challenges: the manual method is inefficient, and the automatic approach is inaccurate. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a solution called CSF (Crowdsourcing Semantic Fusion) that makes full use of the collective wisdom of social users and introduces crowdsourcing computing to semantic fusion. First, the correlation of cross-modal semantics is mined and the semantic objects are normalized for fusion. Second, we employ the dimension reduction and relevance feedback approaches to reduce non-principal components and noise. Finally, we research the storage and distribution mechanism. Experiment results highlight the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach. The proposed method is an effective and practical cross-modal semantic fusion and distribution mechanism for heterogeneous social media, provides a novel idea for social media semantic processing, and uses an interactive visualization framework for social media knowledge mining and retrieval to improve semantic knowledge and the effect of representation.",1
2944955655,Recommendation of Heterogeneous Cultural Heritage Objects for the Promotion of Tourism,"The cultural heritage of a region, be it a highly visited one or not, is a formidable asset for the promotion of its tourism. In many places around the world, an important part of this cultural heritage has been catalogued by initiatives backed by governments and organisations. However, as of today, most of this data has been mostly unknown, or of difficult access, to the general public. In this paper, we present research that aims to leverage this data to promote tourism. Our first field of application focuses on the French Pyrenees. In order to achieve our goal, we worked on two fronts: (i) the ability to export this data from their original databases and data models to well-known open data platforms; and (ii) the proposition of an open-source algorithm and framework capable of recommending a sequence of cultural heritage points of interests (POIs) to be visited by tourists. This itinerary recommendation approach is original in many aspects: it not only considers the user preferences and popularity of POIs, but it also integrates different contextual information about the user as well as the relevance of specific sequences of POIs (strong links between POIs). The ability to export the cultural heritage data as open data and to recommend sequences of POIs are being integrated in a first prototype.",0
