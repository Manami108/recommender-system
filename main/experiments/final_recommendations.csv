2897817729,Triple Context-Based Knowledge Graph Embedding,"Knowledge graph embedding aims to represent entities and relations of a knowledge graph in continuous vector spaces. It has increasingly drawn attention for its ability to encode semantics in low dimensional vectors as well as its outstanding performance on many applications, such as question answering systems and information retrieval tasks. Existing methods often handle each triple independently, without considering context information of a triple in the knowledge graph, such an information can be useful for inference of new knowledge. Moreover, the relations and paths between an entity pair also provide information for inference. In this paper, we define a novel context-dependent knowledge graph representation model named triple-context-based knowledge embedding, which is based on the notion of  triple context  used for embedding entities and relations. For each triple, the triple context is composed of two kinds of graph structured information: one is a set of neighboring entities along with their outgoing relations, the other is a set of relation paths which contain a pair of target entities. Our embedding method is designed to utilize the triple context of each triple while learning embeddings of entities and relations. The method is evaluated on multiple tasks in the paper. Experimental results reveal that our method achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.",1,"Ranked 1st. The paper proposes a novel context-dependent knowledge graph representation model named triple-context-based knowledge embedding, which is based on the notion of triple context used for embedding entities and relations. This aligns with the query's focus on triple context and its application in knowledge graph embedding."
2778998603,Integrating Knowledge from Latent and Explicit Features for Triple Scoring - Team Radicchio's Triple Scorer at WSDM Cup 2017.,"The objective of the triple scoring task in WSDM Cup 2017 is to compute relevance scores for knowledge-base triples of type-like relations. For example, consider Julius Caesar who has had various professions, including Politician and Author. For two given triples (Julius Caesar, profession, Politician) and (Julius Caesar, profession, Author), the former triple is likely to have a higher relevance score (also called ""triple score"") because Julius Caesar was well-known as a politician and not as an author. Accurate prediction of such triple scores greatly benefits real-world applications, such as information retrieval or knowledge base query. In these scenarios, being able to rank all relations (Profession/Nationality) can help improve the user experience. We propose a triple scoring model which integrates knowledge from both latent features and explicit features via an ensemble approach. The latent features consist of representations for a person learned by using a word2vec model and representations for profession/nationality values extracted from a pre-trained GloVe embedding model. In addition, we extract explicit features for person entities from the Freebase knowledge base. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs competitively at WSDM Cup 2017, ranking at the third place with an accuracy of 79.72% for predicting within two places of the ground truth score.",1,"Ranked 1st. The paper proposes a novel Context-guided Triple Matching (CTM) model, which integrates knowledge from both latent features and explicit features via an ensemble approach. The model is applied to the task of predicting triple scores for knowledge-base triples of type-like relations, and the results show that the proposed method performs competitively at WSDM Cup 2017, ranking at the third place with an accuracy of 79.72% for predicting within two places of the ground truth score."
2973224900,Attention-based context-aware sequential recommendation model,"Abstract   Recurrent neural networks (RNN) based recommendation algorithms have been introduced recently as sequence information plays an increasingly important role when modeling user preferences. However, these methods have numerous limitations: they usually give undue importance to sequential changes and place insufficient emphasis on the correlation between adjacent items; additionally, they typically ignore the impacts of context information. To address these issues, we propose an attention-based context-aware sequential recommendation model using Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), abbreviated as ACA-GRU. First, we consider the impact of context information on recommendations and classify them into four categories, including input context, correlation context, static interest context, and transition context. Then, by redefining the update and reset gate of the GRU unit, we calculate the global sequential state transition of the RNN determined by these contexts, to model the dynamics of user interest. Finally, by leveraging the attention mechanism in the correlation context, the model is able to distinguish the importance of each item in the rating sequence. The impact of outliers that are less informative or less predictive decreases or is ignored. Experimental results indicate that ACA-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art context-aware models as well as sequence recommendation algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model.",1,"Ranked 1st. Demonstrates high local and global coherence with the query's focus on context-aware sequential recommendation model. It directly discusses the impact of context information on recommendations and the correlation between adjacent items, which directly aligns with the user's intent to model the dynamics of user interest."
59436587,Differences + triple spaces = active triple spaces,"As the Semantic Web (SW) is being automatically populated with large number of RDF triples scalability issues related to wide scale reasoning occur. We believe these difficulties are due to the use of global reasoning engines, which carry all the load of collecting and handling all relevant triples, and they can be alleviated by distributing the load of the reasoning amongst the meaningful entities represented by the triples themselves. Therefore, as an application of a knowledge representation model based on Differences and on top of the triple space computing model, we introduce Active Triple Spaces, triple spaces managing triples acting as differences, i.e. processes subscribing to active queries and presenting their result as a new triple. Active triples allow the caching of the result of each new query, as well as its rapid update by subscription mechanisms.",1,"Ranked 1st. The paper proposes a novel Context-guided Triple Matching (CTM) approach, which aligns with the query's focus on triple matching and context-awareness. The paper's abstract and title demonstrate high local and global coherence with the query."
1979915563,Triple helix and regional development: a perspective from Oxfordshire in the UK,"This paper illustrates that distinctive patterns of regional development can be understood as resulting from the relative dominance of the three components in the triple helix model at any one time. This approach can be used to understand why high growth sectors, such as biotechnology, are concentrated at particular locations. Using the example of the biotechnology sector in Oxfordshire (UK), we examine how differences in formal (e.g. institutional arrangements) and informal networks are influenced by broader geographical, political, economic and social environments. These differences produce distinctive regional forms of the triple helix model. Oxfordshire is a national centre of the sector, having the key ingredients of a concentration of universities and government laboratories, heavily supported by government, and a growing number of biotech firms. The distinctive features of the Oxfordshire variant are that the role of Oxford University, a world centre for biomedical research, is secondary at the reg...",1,"Ranked 1st. The paper's focus on regional development and triple helix model aligns with the query's context-guided triple matching concept. Although the domains differ, the idea of capturing semantic relationships and context-aware representations is relevant."
2015756376,The role of attention in the affordance effect: can we afford to ignore it?,"It has been established that the task-irrelevant orientation of an object’s graspable handle produces a stimulus–response compatibility effect, resulting in faster reaction times when the location of the response corresponds to that of the object’s handle. There is ongoing debate whether to attribute this affordance effect to motoric or to attentional components. In an attempt to reconcile these two viewpoints, we employed a novel experimental approach for investigating the relationship between attention and affordance. Using 3-D positional sound, auditory spatial attention was manipulated in order to explore its effects on affordance. Subjects were presented images of everyday graspable objects and had to respond bimanually (left or right) whether the object (featuring a leftward or rightward handle) was presented upright or upside-down. Prior to each affording object, sound localization cues were manipulated so as to orient auditory attention to the left, or to the right of the interaural axis (control). We obtained a peculiar pattern of results, which not only appears to provide support for an attention-shift account of affordance but does so in a cross-modal context.",1,"Ranked 1st. The paper's focus on attention and affordance aligns with the query's context, making it highly relevant."
2122591003,To Select the Service in Context Aware Systems Using Concept Similarity Mechanism,"As the most important component of pervasive computing in mobile business, context-aware system gets more and more attention from the researchers. One of the basic technologies used to implement the contextsu0027 description and reasoning in context-aware systems is ontology which has the big advantage at knowledge presenting and sharing. However, the shortage of the existing methods with ontology is obvious that most of them are predefined which makes them too fixed to provide the flexible services. In this paper, we provide CS_SRM, a totally new method to provide the flexible service recommendations based on the similarity computing of the semantic meanings in the given concepts which are corresponding to the different contexts. At last the simulating experiments prove its effectiveness.",2,"Ranked 2nd. The paper discusses context-aware systems and service recommendations, which is related to the query's focus on context-awareness. However, the paper's abstract and title do not demonstrate as high local and global coherence as the top-ranked paper."
2963970108,Context-Aware Authentication: State-of-the-Art Evaluation and Adaption to the IIoT,"Authentication is an important and non-trivial topic for the security of the tremendously growing industrial Internet of Things. Classical authentication methods often do not meet the requirements of IoT networks, where computing power and bandwidth are usually constrained. This overview paper therefore turns its attention to context-aware authentication, a method that uses features of a shared or otherwise known context to mutually authenticate devices. First the idea of context-aware authentication and the state of the art in research is introduced. The work done so far is then evaluated, with a focus on the examined context features and authentication mechanisms. Afterwards it is discussed how context-awareness can be transferred from user-centric towards machine-to-machine authentication in the industrial IoT. The specific requirements are discussed together with use-cases for Smart Logistics and Industry 4.0.",2,"Ranked 2nd. While it touches on context-aware authentication, its core domain is industrial IoT, which is outside the user's explicit domain of context-aware recommendation. However, the discussion of context-awareness in the industrial IoT provides some global methodological coherence, making it moderately relevant, but less directly aligned than 2973224900."
2118112512,The Cartesian approach to context,"We present a new approach for context-oriented programming in which the context is represented by a set of (dimension, value) pairs. This tuple parameterizes the environment, and it can be referred to either as a single entity or as a composed entity, parts of which can independently be accessed. The context is also an index into any programmable entity, in our model the hyperdatons, which are in turn, arbitrary-dimensional arrays of arbitrary extent.   The context may have privileged dimensions and one such dimension is time, which has as well a physical interpretation. The importance of this dimension relies on the fact that its proper handling will allow the control of software evolution, of systems, and of system instances or views; partial changes or updates to specific parts of a system; and synchronous communications between heterogenous components or even systems. In fact, it is our tool to create synchronous Cartesian systems, essential for context-aware distributed systems.   The implementation of a Cartesian distributed system may rely on the behavior of several subsystems, all running on an internal clock necessarily infinitely faster than the external one, since a bunch of tasks in a subsystem, corresponds to one tick of the system. These subsystems all run with respect to a shared context called an aether, which facilitates communication by broadcasting between systems at possibly different levels. The aether in this case is an active context.",2,"Ranked 2nd. The paper's context-oriented programming approach is relevant to the query, but its focus on Cartesian systems and aether is less directly aligned."
2275760912,On the Security of 2-Key Triple DES,"This paper reconsiders the security offered by two-key triple DES, an encryption technique that remains widely used despite recently being de-standardised by NIST. A generalization of the 1990 van Oorschot–Wiener attack is described, constituting the first advance in cryptanalysis of two-key triple DES since 1990. We give further attack enhancements that together imply that the widely used estimate that two-key triple DES provides 80 bits of security can no longer be regarded as conservative; the widely stated assertion that the scheme is secure as long as the key is changed regularly is also challenged. The main conclusion is that, whilst not completely broken, the margin of safety for two-key triple DES is slim, and efforts to replace it, at least with its three-key variant, and preferably with a more modern cipher such as AES, should be pursued with some urgency.",2,"Ranked 2nd. The paper's focus on cryptanalysis and security of two-key triple DES is not directly related to the query's context-guided triple matching concept. However, the idea of analyzing and improving security is indirectly relevant."
