2923779212,Selective Attention for Context-aware Neural Machine Translation,"Despite the progress made in sentence-level NMT, current systems still fall short at achieving fluent, good quality translation for a full document. Recent works in context-aware NMT consider only a few previous sentences as context and may not scale to entire documents. To this end, we propose a novel and scalable top-down approach to hierarchical attention for context-aware NMT which uses sparse attention to selectively focus on relevant sentences in the document context and then attends to key words in those sentences. We also propose single-level attention approaches based on sentence or word-level information in the context. The document-level context representation, produced from these attention modules, is integrated into the encoder or decoder of the Transformer model depending on whether we use monolingual or bilingual context. Our experiments and evaluation on English-German datasets in different document MT settings show that our selective attention approach not only significantly outperforms context-agnostic baselines but also surpasses context-aware baselines in most cases.",0.92,0.85,0.89,0.89
2979739834,Learning Visual Relationship and Context-Aware Attention for Image Captioning,"Abstract   Image captioning which automatically generates natural language descriptions for images has attracted lots of research attentions and there have been substantial progresses with attention based captioning methods. However, most attention-based image captioning methods focus on extracting visual information in regions of interest for sentence generation and usually ignore the relational reasoning among those regions of interest in an image. Moreover, these methods do not take into account previously attended regions which can be used to guide the subsequent attention selection. In this paper, we propose a novel method to implicitly model the relationship among regions of interest in an image with a graph neural network, as well as a novel context-aware attention mechanism to guide attention selection by fully memorizing previously attended visual content. Compared with the existing attention-based image captioning methods, ours can not only learn relation-aware visual representations for image captioning, but also consider historical context information on previous attention. We perform extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets: MS COCO and Flickr30K, and the experimental results indicate that our proposed method is able to outperform various state-of-the-art methods in terms of the widely used evaluation metrics.",0.92,0.85,0.89,0.89
2956118103,Context-Aware Co-attention Neural Network for Service Recommendations,"Context-aware recommender systems are able to produce more accurate recommendations by harnessing contextual information, such as consuming time and location. Further, user reviews as an important information resource, providing valuable information about usersu0027 preferences, itemsu0027 aspects, and implicit contextual features, could be used to enhance the embeddings of users, items, and contexts. However, few works attempt to incorporate these two types of information, i.e., contexts and reviews, into their models. Recent state-of-the-art context-aware methods only characterize relations between two types of entities among users, items and contexts, which may be insufficient, as the final prediction is closely related to all the three types of entities. In this paper, we propose a novel model, named Context-aware Co-Attention Neural Network (CCANN), to dynamically infer relations between contexts and users/items, and subsequently to model the degree of matching between usersu0027 contextual preferences and itemsu0027 context-aware aspects via co-attention mechanism. To better leverage the information from reviews, we propose an embedding method, named Entity2Vec, to jointly learn embeddings of different entities (users, items and contexts) with words in a textual review. Experimental results, on three datasets composed of millions of review records crawled from TripAdvisor, demonstrate that our CCANN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation methods, and Entity2Vec can further boost the modelu0027s performance.",0.85,0.78,0.82,0.82
2973224900,Attention-based context-aware sequential recommendation model,"Abstract   Recurrent neural networks (RNN) based recommendation algorithms have been introduced recently as sequence information plays an increasingly important role when modeling user preferences. However, these methods have numerous limitations: they usually give undue importance to sequential changes and place insufficient emphasis on the correlation between adjacent items; additionally, they typically ignore the impacts of context information. To address these issues, we propose an attention-based context-aware sequential recommendation model using Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), abbreviated as ACA-GRU. First, we consider the impact of context information on recommendations and classify them into four categories, including input context, correlation context, static interest context, and transition context. Then, by redefining the update and reset gate of the GRU unit, we calculate the global sequential state transition of the RNN determined by these contexts, to model the dynamics of user interest. Finally, by leveraging the attention mechanism in the correlation context, the model is able to distinguish the importance of each item in the rating sequence. The impact of outliers that are less informative or less predictive decreases or is ignored. Experimental results indicate that ACA-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art context-aware models as well as sequence recommendation algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model.",0.85,0.78,0.83,0.82
1569889253,Using categorial Context-SHOIQ(D+) DL to migrate between the context-aware scenes,"An important issue in semantic web ontology application is how to improve ontological evolvement to fit the semantics of the unceasingly changing context. This paper presents a context-based formalism- Context-SHOIQ(D+) DL which is under the frame of SHOIQ(D+) DL, a kind of description logic, from the category theory point of view. The core part of the proposed formalism is a categorial context based on the SHOIQ(D+) DL, that captures and explicitly represents the information about contexts. Additionally, this paper presents some meta languages about reasoning and knowledge representation, finally discusses context-aware migration between different scenes with the categorial Context-SHOIQ(D+)DL.",0.62,0.55,0.59,0.59
2084947233,"Context-aware systems: the 'right' information, at the 'right' time, in the 'right' place, in the 'right' way, to the 'right' person","Based on the assumption that the scarce resource for many people in the world today is not information but human attention, the challenge for future human-centered computer systems is not to deliver more information ""to anyone, at anytime, and from anywhere,"" but to provide ""the u0027rightu0027 information, at the u0027rightu0027 time, in the u0027rightu0027 place, in the u0027rightu0027 way, to the u0027rightu0027 person.""   This article develops a multidimensional framework for context-aware systems to address this challenge, transcending existing frameworks that limited their concerns to particular aspects of context-awareness and paid little attention to potential pitfalls. The framework is based on insights derived from the development and assessment of a variety of different systems that we have developed over the last twenty years to explore different dimensions of context awareness.   Specific challenges, guidelines, and design trade-offs (promises and pitfalls) are derived from the framework for designing the next generation of context-aware systems. These systems will support advanced interactions for assisting humans (individuals and groups) to become more knowledgeable, more productive, and more creative by emphasizing context awareness as a fundamental design requirement.",0.62,0.55,0.59,0.59
2963970108,Context-Aware Authentication: State-of-the-Art Evaluation and Adaption to the IIoT,"Authentication is an important and non-trivial topic for the security of the tremendously growing industrial Internet of Things. Classical authentication methods often do not meet the requirements of IoT networks, where computing power and bandwidth are usually constrained. This overview paper therefore turns its attention to context-aware authentication, a method that uses features of a shared or otherwise known context to mutually authenticate devices. First the idea of context-aware authentication and the state of the art in research is introduced. The work done so far is then evaluated, with a focus on the examined context features and authentication mechanisms. Afterwards it is discussed how context-awareness can be transferred from user-centric towards machine-to-machine authentication in the industrial IoT. The specific requirements are discussed together with use-cases for Smart Logistics and Industry 4.0.",0.45,0.38,0.42,0.42
1967127022,Context-aware filtering for collaborative web systems: adapting the awareness information to the user's context,"We propose a context-based filtering process which aims at adapting the awareness information delivered to mobile users by collaborative web systems. This filtering process relies on a model of context which integrates both a physical and an organizational dimensions and allows to represent the useru0027s current context as well as general profiles. These profiles are descriptions of useru0027s potential contexts and express the awareness information filtering rules to apply when the useru0027s current context matches one of them. These rules reflect the useru0027s preferences given a context. We describe how the filtering process performs in two steps, one for identifying the general profiles that apply, and a second for selecting the awareness information. We also discuss the patterns matching algorithms used in the filtering process to compare the contexts descriptions.",0.45,0.38,0.42,0.42
2158715331,Mnemonic Context Effect in Two Cultures: Attention to Memory Representations?,"In two experiments we demonstrate a substantial cross-cultural difference in a mnemonic context effect, whereby a magnitude estimate of a simple stimulus such as a line or circle is biased toward the center of the distribution of previously seen instances of the same class. In support of the hypothesis that Asians are more likely than Americans to disperse their attention to both the target stimulus and its mnemonic context, this effect was consistently larger for Japanese than for Americans. Moreover, the cultural difference was attenuated by an experimentally induced belief in class homogeneity that augmented the context effect itself in both cultures. More important, these belief effects happened in the absence of any objective change in stimulus distribution. Implications for sociocultural shaping of cognition are discussed.",0.38,0.32,0.35,0.35
2106378965,Using context-aware crossover to improve the performance of GP,"This paper describes the use of a recently introduced crossover operator for GP, context-aware crossover. Given a randomly selected subtree from one parent, context-aware crossover will always find the best location to place the subtree in the other parent.We examine the performance of GP when context-aware crossover is used as an extra crossover operator, and show that standard crossover is far more destructive, and that performance is better when only context-aware crossover is used.There is still a place for standard crossover, however, and results suggest that using standard crossover in the initial part of the run and then switching to context-aware crossover yields the best performance.We show that, across a range of standard GP benchmark problems, context-aware crossover produces a higher best fitness as well as a higher mean fitness, and even manages to solve the 11-bit multiplexer problem without ADFs. Furthermore, the individuals produced this way are much smaller than standard GP, and far fewer individual evaluations are required, so GP achieves a higher fitness by evaluating fewer and smaller individuals.",0.38,0.32,0.35,0.35
