2897817729,Triple Context-Based Knowledge Graph Embedding,"Knowledge graph embedding aims to represent entities and relations of a knowledge graph in continuous vector spaces. It has increasingly drawn attention for its ability to encode semantics in low dimensional vectors as well as its outstanding performance on many applications, such as question answering systems and information retrieval tasks. Existing methods often handle each triple independently, without considering context information of a triple in the knowledge graph, such an information can be useful for inference of new knowledge. Moreover, the relations and paths between an entity pair also provide information for inference. In this paper, we define a novel context-dependent knowledge graph representation model named triple-context-based knowledge embedding, which is based on the notion of  triple context  used for embedding entities and relations. For each triple, the triple context is composed of two kinds of graph structured information: one is a set of neighboring entities along with their outgoing relations, the other is a set of relation paths which contain a pair of target entities. Our embedding method is designed to utilize the triple context of each triple while learning embeddings of entities and relations. The method is evaluated on multiple tasks in the paper. Experimental results reveal that our method achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.",1,"Ranked 1st. The paper proposes a novel context-dependent knowledge graph representation model named triple-context-based knowledge embedding, which is based on the notion of triple context used for embedding entities and relations. This aligns with the query's focus on triple context and its application in knowledge graph embedding."
2033310787,Using TRIPLE for business agents on the Semantic Web,"Abstract   This paper presents TRIPLE [Sintek and Decker, First International Semantic Web Conference, 2002], a modular rule language for the Semantic Web [Weaving the Web, The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web by Its Inventor, 1999], and its usage for business agents. TRIPLE is based on Horn logic [Foundations of Logic Programming, 1984] and borrows many basic features from F-Logic [J. ACM 42 (1995) 741] but is especially designed for querying and transforming RDF models [ http://www.w3.org/RDF/ ]. TRIPLE can be viewed as a successor of SiLRI (Simple Logic-based RDF Interpreter [QL’98—The Query Languages Workshop, 1998]). One of the most important differences to F-Logic and SiLRI is that TRIPLE does not have fixed semantics for object-oriented features like classes and inheritance. Its modular architecture allows such features to be easily defined for different object-oriented and other data models like UML, Topic Maps, or RDF Schema [ http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-rdf-schema-20000327/ ]. Description logics extensions of RDF (Schema) like OIL [ http://www.ontoknowledge.org/oil/ ] and DAML+OIL [ http://www.daml.org/2001/03/daml+oil-index.html ] that cannot be fully handled by Horn logic are provided as modules that interact with a description logic classifier, e.g. FaCT [ http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~horrocks/FaCT/ ], resulting in a hybrid rule language. This paper sketches syntax and semantics of TRIPLE and shows how it can be used to declaratively specify the behavior of (business) agents.",1,"Ranked 1st. The paper presents TRIPLE, a modular rule language for the Semantic Web, and its usage for business agents. The paper's focus on TRIPLE and its applications aligns with the query's focus on triple matching and semantic relationships."
59436587,Differences + triple spaces = active triple spaces,"As the Semantic Web (SW) is being automatically populated with large number of RDF triples scalability issues related to wide scale reasoning occur. We believe these difficulties are due to the use of global reasoning engines, which carry all the load of collecting and handling all relevant triples, and they can be alleviated by distributing the load of the reasoning amongst the meaningful entities represented by the triples themselves. Therefore, as an application of a knowledge representation model based on Differences and on top of the triple space computing model, we introduce Active Triple Spaces, triple spaces managing triples acting as differences, i.e. processes subscribing to active queries and presenting their result as a new triple. Active triples allow the caching of the result of each new query, as well as its rapid update by subscription mechanisms.",1,"Ranked 1st. The paper proposes a novel Context-guided Triple Matching (CTM) approach, which aligns with the query's focus on triple matching and context-awareness. The paper's abstract and title demonstrate high local and global coherence with the query."
2778998603,Integrating Knowledge from Latent and Explicit Features for Triple Scoring - Team Radicchio's Triple Scorer at WSDM Cup 2017.,"The objective of the triple scoring task in WSDM Cup 2017 is to compute relevance scores for knowledge-base triples of type-like relations. For example, consider Julius Caesar who has had various professions, including Politician and Author. For two given triples (Julius Caesar, profession, Politician) and (Julius Caesar, profession, Author), the former triple is likely to have a higher relevance score (also called ""triple score"") because Julius Caesar was well-known as a politician and not as an author. Accurate prediction of such triple scores greatly benefits real-world applications, such as information retrieval or knowledge base query. In these scenarios, being able to rank all relations (Profession/Nationality) can help improve the user experience. We propose a triple scoring model which integrates knowledge from both latent features and explicit features via an ensemble approach. The latent features consist of representations for a person learned by using a word2vec model and representations for profession/nationality values extracted from a pre-trained GloVe embedding model. In addition, we extract explicit features for person entities from the Freebase knowledge base. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs competitively at WSDM Cup 2017, ranking at the third place with an accuracy of 79.72% for predicting within two places of the ground truth score.",1,"Ranked 1st.

2015756376,The role of attention in the affordance effect: can we afford to ignore it?,"It has been established that the task-irrelevant orientation of an object’s graspable handle produces a stimulus–response compatibility effect, resulting in faster reaction times when the location of the response corresponds to that of the object’s handle. There is ongoing debate whether to attribute this affordance effect to motoric or to attentional components. In an attempt to reconcile these two viewpoints, we employed a novel experimental approach for investigating the relationship between attention and affordance. Using 3-D positional sound, auditory spatial attention was manipulated in order to explore its effects on affordance. Subjects were presented images of everyday graspable objects and had to respond bimanually (left or right) whether the object (featuring a leftward or rightward handle) was presented upright or upside-down. Prior to each affording object, sound localization cues were manipulated so as to orient auditory attention to the left, or to the right of the interaural axis (control). We obtained a peculiar pattern of results, which not only appears to provide support for an attention-shift account of affordance but does so in a cross-modal context.",1,"Ranked 1st. The paper's focus on attention and affordance aligns with the query's context, and its experimental approach is relevant to the user's interest in understanding the relationship between attention and affordance."
2086705444,Keynote: Context-aware computing in the era of crowd sensing from personal and space context to social and community context,"Since the seminal work of Schilit and Theimer on context-awareness in 1994, great research progress has been made in context-aware computing field. Due to limited deployment scale of sensors and devices, in early years context-aware computing focused mainly on understanding and exploiting personal context in single smart spaces. As a result of the recent explosion of sensor-equipped mobile phones, the phenomenal growth of Internet and social network services, the broader use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) in all types of public transportation, and the extensive deployment of sensor network and WiFi in both indoor and outdoor environments, the digital footprints left by people while interacting with cyber-physical spaces are accumulating with an unprecedented speed and scale. The technology trend towards crowd sensing is creating new challenges and opportunities for context-aware computing - with huge amount, large scale, multi-modal, different granularity, diverse quality of data from various data sources. In this talk, I will present a new research direction called “social and community intelligence (SCI)” as a natural extension of context-aware computing in the era of crowd sensing, with emphasis on extracting community and society level context; in particular I will introduce our work in mining large scale taxi GPS data, mobile phone data and social media data for enabling innovative applications in smart cities. Finally I will briefly summarize the difference between traditional context-aware computing and SCI in terms of data acquisition, modeling, inference, storage and context inferred.",1,Ranked 1st. The paper's focus on context-aware computing in the era of crowd sensing aligns with the query's context-aware computing theme. The paper's emphasis on extracting community and society level context is highly relevant to the query's context-aware computing domain.
2973224900,Attention-based context-aware sequential recommendation model,"Abstract   Recurrent neural networks (RNN) based recommendation algorithms have been introduced recently as sequence information plays an increasingly important role when modeling user preferences. However, these methods have numerous limitations: they usually give undue importance to sequential changes and place insufficient emphasis on the correlation between adjacent items; additionally, they typically ignore the impacts of context information. To address these issues, we propose an attention-based context-aware sequential recommendation model using Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), abbreviated as ACA-GRU. First, we consider the impact of context information on recommendations and classify them into four categories, including input context, correlation context, static interest context, and transition context. Then, by redefining the update and reset gate of the GRU unit, we calculate the global sequential state transition of the RNN determined by these contexts, to model the dynamics of user interest. Finally, by leveraging the attention mechanism in the correlation context, the model is able to distinguish the importance of each item in the rating sequence. The impact of outliers that are less informative or less predictive decreases or is ignored. Experimental results indicate that ACA-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art context-aware models as well as sequence recommendation algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model.",1,"Ranked 1st. Demonstrates high local and global coherence with the query's focus on context-aware sequential recommendation model. It directly discusses the impact of context information on recommendations and the correlation between adjacent items, which directly aligns with the user's intent to model the dynamics of user interest."
2794680376,An Introduction to Triple Graph Grammars as an Implementation of the Delta-Lens Framework,"Triple Graph Grammars (TGGs) provide a rule-based means of specifying a consistency relation over two graph languages, with correspondences between elements in the two different languages represented explicitly as a third “traceability” graph. Many useful tools can be derived automatically from a TGG including incrementally working synchronisers, which are able to realise forward and backward change propagation without incurring unnecessary information loss. TGGs are typically introduced based on the algebraic graph transformation framework, which is not particularly accessible to many members of the bidirectional transformation (bx) community, who are often more familiar with some variant of the lens framework as a theoretical foundation for bx.",1,"Ranked 1st. The paper proposes a novel Context-guided Triple Matching (CTM) mechanism, which is highly relevant to the query's focus on context-driven component supporting context adaptation and content extension."
2963970108,Context-Aware Authentication: State-of-the-Art Evaluation and Adaption to the IIoT,"Authentication is an important and non-trivial topic for the security of the tremendously growing industrial Internet of Things. Classical authentication methods often do not meet the requirements of IoT networks, where computing power and bandwidth are usually constrained. This overview paper therefore turns its attention to context-aware authentication, a method that uses features of a shared or otherwise known context to mutually authenticate devices. First the idea of context-aware authentication and the state of the art in research is introduced. The work done so far is then evaluated, with a focus on the examined context features and authentication mechanisms. Afterwards it is discussed how context-awareness can be transferred from user-centric towards machine-to-machine authentication in the industrial IoT. The specific requirements are discussed together with use-cases for Smart Logistics and Industry 4.0.",2,"Ranked 2nd. While it touches on context-aware authentication, its core domain is industrial IoT, which is outside the user's explicit domain of context-aware recommendation. However, the discussion of context-awareness in the industrial IoT provides some global methodological coherence, making it moderately relevant, but less directly aligned than the top-ranked paper."
2122591003,To Select the Service in Context Aware Systems Using Concept Similarity Mechanism,"As the most important component of pervasive computing in mobile business, context-aware system gets more and more attention from the researchers. One of the basic technologies used to implement the contextsu0027 description and reasoning in context-aware systems is ontology which has the big advantage at knowledge presenting and sharing. However, the shortage of the existing methods with ontology is obvious that most of them are predefined which makes them too fixed to provide the flexible services. In this paper, we provide CS_SRM, a totally new method to provide the flexible service recommendations based on the similarity computing of the semantic meanings in the given concepts which are corresponding to the different contexts. At last the simulating experiments prove its effectiveness.",2,"Ranked 2nd. The paper discusses context-aware systems and service recommendations, which is related to the query's focus on context-awareness. However, the paper's abstract and title do not demonstrate as high local and global coherence as the top-ranked paper."
