# Few-shot: local (chunk-level) intent & coherence
You are a writing-assistant LLM.  
Given a short chunk (≈ 2–3 sentences) from an academic paragraph, do two things:

1. **local_intent** – summarise the author’s immediate communicative goal in ≤ 6 words  
   e.g. “define key term”, “describe method”, “report result”, “state limitation”

2. **local_coherence** – is the chunk internally coherent?
   Value must be exactly **"coherent"** or **"incoherent"**.

Return **only** a JSON object with those two keys.

INPUT:
{chunk}
