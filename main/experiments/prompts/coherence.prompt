You are an expert in computer science and discourse analysis. Given a paragraph from a researcher’s scientific writing, 
your job is to deeply analyze its coherence, cohesion, and communicative intent, and discourse.
First, identify the main point, supporting ideas, and emphasis of the paragraph.
Then evaluate how well each candidate aligns with this discourse structure.
Based on these insights, please rate candidates. 

**When you finish, output ONLY the JSON array**, and **wrap it** between:

<RESULT>
…your array here…
</RESULT>

Do NOT print anything else after that.

TASK
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Read the author’s **paragraph**.
2. Read each candidate **title + abstract**.
3. For every candidate, think *step by step* about:

   • **local_coherence**  – lexical/semantic overlap with *sentence windows*  
   • **paragraph_cohesion** – how well it follows the paragraph’s flow (§-topic chains, pronoun links)  
   • **global_coherence**  – how well it matches the paragraph’s communicative intent (e.g. “fill a gap”, “extend method”),does it match the structure and focus (e.g., main claim vs side note)? ,does it support what the author appears to care most about?

   Score each 0.00 – 1.00   
   Compute **final_score = 0.35·local + 0.35·paragraph + 0.30·global**.

4. Output ONLY the JSON array inside `<RESULT> … </RESULT>`.
   Put any chain-of-thought “scratch-pad” reasoning **outside** the tags.

JSON schema:  
```json
{ "pid": "…",
  "local_score": 0.00,
  "paragraph_score": 0.00,
  "global_score": 0.00,
  "final_score": 0.00 }

PARAGRAPH

[The paragraph discusses collaborative filtering, data sparsity, and cold-start problems in movie recommendation.]
CANDIDATES

PID: A1
Title: “Hybrid Collaborative Filtering with Side-Information”
Abstract: “…we fuse matrix factorisation with user demographic features…”

PID: A2
Title: “Contrastive Learning for Table Detection”
Abstract: “…proposes a model for detecting tables in scanned documents…”

--- chain-of-thought ---
A1 • local 0.82 (many shared terms: “collaborative filtering”, “cold-start”, “demographic”)
• cohesion 0.75 (abstract tackles exactly the highlighted pain-points)
• global 0.78 (extends solution space for sparsity)
A2 • local 0.05 (domain mismatch)
• cohesion 0.04
• global 0.06
--- /chain-of-thought ---
<RESULT> [ {"pid":"A1","local_score":0.82,"paragraph_score":0.75,"global_score":0.78,"final_score":0.78}, {"pid":"A2","local_score":0.05,"paragraph_score":0.04,"global_score":0.06,"final_score":0.05} ] </RESULT>

PARAGRAPH

[Paragraph introduces attention-based relation extraction in biomedical text.]
CANDIDATES

PID: B1
Title: “Attention-Guided Distant Supervision for Bio-RE”
Abstract: “…uses a sentence-level attention mechanism to reduce noise…”

PID: B2
Title: “Adversarial Test Generation for Compilers”
Abstract: “…presents fuzzing strategies for LLVM optimisations…”

--- chain-of-thought ---
B1: strong lexical overlap (“attention”, “relation extraction”), same domain ► high scores
B2: unrelated ► near-zero scores
--- /chain-of-thought ---
<RESULT> [ {"pid":"B1","local_score":0.88,"paragraph_score":0.83,"global_score":0.85,"final_score":0.85}, {"pid":"B2","local_score":0.02,"paragraph_score":0.03,"global_score":0.01,"final_score":0.02} ] </RESULT>

After thinking in <COT>, output your JSON on a new line.
Output ONLY the JSON object—do not include any other text or examples.
Your entire output must be exactly the JSON array, wrapped in <RESULT> tags, with no code fences, no ‘json’ prefix, and no extra commentary.
