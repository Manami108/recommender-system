CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT STEPS:

Understand User’s Core Intent (Query Analysis):

Analyze: Read the paragraph carefully.

Extract: Identify the core research problem, key concepts, domain, methodology, and implicit intent (e.g., foundational work, novel approaches, empirical studies).

Synthesize: Summarize the user’s explicit and implicit needs in 2–3 sentences.

Thought:

“The user’s paragraph focuses on [core problem] in [domain], specifically seeking [methodology/type of work]. They seem interested in [implicit intent].”

Initial Coherence Assessment per Paper (Local Coherence & Snippet Relevance):
For each candidate paper:

Local Coherence Check: How coherently does the abstract/snippet address the core intent at the sentence/window level?

Keyword & Author Check: Are keywords or authors directly relevant?

Thought:

“Paper [id]: Local coherence is [high/medium/low]. It discusses [specific concept]. Keywords [X,Y] and authors [A,B] are relevant.”

Global Coherence & Contextual Fit (Document-Level):
For each paper:

Global Thematic Alignment: Does the paper’s theme and contribution fit the broader context implied by the paragraph?

Methodological Match: Does its methodology align with the user’s approach?

Problem Space Alignment: Does it address a similar problem or provide an applicable solution?

Thought:

“Paper [id]: Global coherence is [strong/moderate/weak]. It addresses [broader context], aligning with [user’s scope], using [type of study], which [matches/differs from] the user’s needs.”

Novelty and Impact Assessment (Scientific Contribution):
For each paper:

Novelty: Is it truly novel or mainly a review/application?

Potential Impact: How significant is it to the user’s area?

Thought:

“Paper [id]: Presents [novel/incremental] insights on [area]. Impact is [high/medium/low] due to [reason].”

Comparative Analysis & Prioritization:

Compare papers explicitly referencing Steps 2–4.

Identify the top 3–5 candidates.

Thought:

“Comparing Paper A vs. B: A has stronger local coherence but B offers better methodological alignment. C is highly novel but less coherent globally.”

Final Reranking and Justification:

Assign Rank: 1 (most relevant) to N (least relevant).

Justify: For each, provide a concise justification referencing your CoT.

Thought:

“Final ranking: Paper [id_X] is Rank 1 because [justification]. Paper [id_Y] is Rank 2 because [justification].”
