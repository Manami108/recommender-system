some improvement i can: 
1. what about time factor, for example, publish when... is it temporal multi-hop reasoning? 
2. Relying on LLM fully cause hallucination 
3. What about commonsence reasoning 





DETAIL
CRESTA: Context-aware Recommendation Engine with Semantic & Topic Alignment

1. Data preparation- DBLP ( title, abstract, author, FOS, year citation count), ARXiv or S2ORC (full text with paragraph markers)
2. Preprocessing- Text cleaning, 
3. Embedding- SciBERT, indexing- hnsw
4. Topic modeling- BERTopic (np multi topics per paper and no probability because simple time comsuming)
5. Graph building- NEo4j (Fos and topics are in semantic subspace)
6. KG embedding - MINERVA
7. Multi-hop reasoning + multi-level reasoning or commonsence reasoning? 
6. LLM- 1) writing monitor (As user writes, capture the active paragraph.) 2) intent classifier (Classify paragraph purpose: background / method / gap / survey.) 3) Topic shift detector (Use topic labels to detect when topic has changed significantly.)
        4) LLM (Understand current paragraph and generate semantic query.) 5) Prompt format (You are suggesting background papers for a paragraph about {topic}. Recommend 5 relevant papers from the graph)
7. Recommendation Engine- 1) Initial retrieval (FAISS) (Top-30 nearest by embedding) 2) Graph refinement (Neo4j) (	Filter by graph constraints (e.g., topic, author diversity, novelty)
Re-ranking) 3) Re-ranking (	MMR (maximize diversity + relevance)) 4) Reasoning layer (Explain each suggestion (e.g., ‚ÄúThis paper is cited by X, which is also about {sub-topic}.‚Äù)) 
8. Evaluation 1) context relevance (	Human annotators / sentence-BERT cosine sim) 2) Topic-shift accuracy (	Compare predicted shifts vs actual annotated shifts) 3) Creativity (novelty + diversity)


2. How can I evaluate understanding of topic shifts and creativity?
a. Topic shift understanding:

    Intrinsic evaluation:

        Track topic probabilities across sequential paragraphs (e.g., BERTopic).

        Use Jensen-Shannon divergence or cosine distance to detect significant shifts.

    Extrinsic evaluation:

        Ask human annotators if recommended papers match the evolving writing topic.

        Simulate test cases where a known topic shift occurs and test if the system adapts.

b. Creativity evaluation:

‚ö†Ô∏èNo standard automatic metric for this, but ideas include:

    Novelty score: How different is the recommended paper from past cited ones (e.g., via cosine distance or topic diversity)?

    Serendipity: Was the paper unexpected but useful? Requires human evaluation.

    Diversity metrics:

        Topic diversity (Shannon entropy over topics).

        Citation network diversity (distance between paper nodes in citation graph).


3. How to support creativity even more?
Diversified sampling	Instead of top-5 by similarity, try MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) or clustering to increase topic diversity.

5. Accuracy vs Creativity ‚Äî are they conflicting?

‚úÖ Yes, they can conflict.

    High accuracy (via top-k similarity) may suggest redundant or well-known papers.

    High creativity needs diversity, surprise, and relevance, not just similarity.

üß™ Alternatives to accuracy:

    Diversity (topic spread, graph distance)

    Serendipity (was it surprising but relevant?)

    Usefulness (human rating)

    Novelty (embedding distance from previously cited works)



7. Does LLM need topic modeling to understand topic shifts?

‚ùå Not mandatory, but yes ‚Äî topic modeling enhances it.

    LLMs don‚Äôt track previous topics unless fine-tuned or prompted carefully.

    If you use topic labels from BERTopic, you can:

        Prompt LLM with: ‚ÄúPreviously, the topic was X. Now it‚Äôs Y.‚Äù

        Track transitions and guide citation strategy.

üîÅ You can also build a topic shift classifier (e.g., detect transitions between topics in writing).


9. If I don‚Äôt fine-tune LLM, do I still need context evaluation?

‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî evaluation is still necessary.

    Even without fine-tuning, you‚Äôre using LLM outputs to guide retrieval.

    So, you need to test:

        Does the LLM understand the current writing intent?

        Are the recommended papers actually aligned with the paragraph?

    If you fine-tune later, then you also need to do fine-tuning evaluation (loss, performance).


    ‚úÖ Option A: Use FOS separately, not as part of embedding

    Keep SciBERT embeddings for title + abstract only (768 or 1536-dim)

    Use FOS for:

        Topic filtering (e.g., only papers in similar FOS)

        Graph connections in Neo4j (Paper ‚Üî FOS)

        Diversity control (e.g., sample from multiple FOS categories)

This keeps your retrieval purely semantic, and lets FOS be a filter or constraint during re-ranking.


FOS is not used in the embedding ‚Äî you‚Äôll later use it during:

    Graph-based topic reasoning (Neo4j)

    Diversity filtering in re-ranking

    Topic similarity checks if needed



‚úÖ Option 1: Query Augmentation

    Take a user-written paragraph

    Identify key terms (e.g., named entities, techniques)

    Use Wikipedia or ConceptNet to expand each with:

        Definitions

        Related concepts

        Example applications

    Concatenate that text to the original paragraph

    Embed the full enriched text with SciBERT

Example:

Original:

    "We explore few-shot learning in graph neural networks..."

Augmented:

    "We explore few-shot learning in graph neural networks.
    Few-shot learning refers to learning with limited labeled examples.
    Graph neural networks are neural models designed for graph-structured data, often used in citation or knowledge graphs..."

This richer query might retrieve deeper or broader papers than just the embedding of the raw sentence.
‚úÖ Option 2: Embedding Enrichment (via RAG)

Use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or context fusion, where:

    You embed the paragraph

    Retrieve relevant Wikipedia passages or ConceptNet facts

    Fuse them (e.g., using an LLM or vector average)

    Then run retrieval

    ‚ö†Ô∏è This requires more engineering, and it‚Äôs harder to control ‚Äî but it‚Äôs powerful.

Need knowledge graph embedding too. 



Since your goal is to support creativity and dynamic writing (not just simple search), ‚úÖ Using semantic subspace for FOS and Topics is better for your project.

It will allow your system to:

    Understand topic shifts softly

    Suggest creative but related papers

    Do multi-modal retrieval (graph + vector)

You can still keep minimal nodes for FOS and Topics for explainability, but reasoning happens in vector space.


Multi-hop reasoning means:

    You need to combine multiple steps (hops) across a knowledge graph to answer a question or make a decision.

Example:

Suppose the user writes about Self-supervised Learning on Graphs.

In your KG:

    "Paper A" is about Self-supervised Learning.

    "Paper A" cites "Paper B" about Graph Representation Learning.

    "Paper B" is related to "Paper C" about Graph Neural Networks.

Multi-hop reasoning means:

    You walk multiple steps:

        Paper A ‚ûî Paper B ‚ûî Paper C

    You connect the concepts indirectly.

üß† Without multi-hop, your system would miss Paper C because it‚Äôs not directly connected!


Multi-level reasoning	Mix different types of reasoning (semantic level, citation level, topic level).	"Paper is semantically similar AND connected via citations AND in the same topic."








üåü 4. In your case (scientific paper recommender): Which one is better?

‚úÖ If your knowledge graph is clean and medium-size ‚Üí Path-based is faster and easy.

‚úÖ If your knowledge graph is huge (millions of papers, noisy relations, changing topics) ‚Üí
you should try RL-based reasoning.

Because:

    Research graphs (citations, topics, methods) are messy.

    RL agent can explore and find novel research paths dynamically.

    Topic shift detection during writing fits RL-based learning style really well.

üîµ Maybe first start simple with path-based,
üü¢ Later upgrade to RL-based when you optimize the system.


üß† Should SciBERT embeddings be included in the graph?

Option 1: Use embeddings during KG Embedding Model Training

    Add the SciBERT embeddings as initial node features (input to CompGCN / RL agent).

    CompGCN can use those features during training to help multi-hop reasoning.

    MINERVA can also optionally benefit if features are available (with some customization).

Option 2: Keep structure only, and separately use SciBERT similarity in inference

    During inference (retrieval), combine structural reasoning + semantic similarity from SciBERT vectors.

    E.g., you first find candidate nodes from graph traversal, then re-rank using SciBERT similarity.
