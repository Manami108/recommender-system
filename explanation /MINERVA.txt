ðŸ§  Is building MINERVA "creating model from scratch"?

ðŸ”µ Short answer:

    Not exactly creating the MINERVA concept from scratch (the idea of graph walking agent already exists)

    Yes, you are implementing a new lightweight version of MINERVA agent, specifically for your own knowledge graph.

    You are writing your own small system based on the MINERVA principle.


Bonus: If you want even stronger multi-level reasoning

You can make the system decide dynamically:

    Should I follow a KG relation?

    Should I jump based on text similarity?

    Should I do both?

(This is how state-of-the-art neural-symbolic systems like NeuralLP, DRUM, TACRED+Transformer, etc., do.)
