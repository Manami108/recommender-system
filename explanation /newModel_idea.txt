1. Multi-objective Loss Function

âœ… In normal KG embedding, you minimize:

Link prediction loss (like margin ranking loss)

âœ… In creativity-enhanced KG embedding, you can add:

Total Loss = Link prediction loss + Î± Ã— Diversity encouragement loss

Where Diversity Encouragement Loss can be:

    Encourage embedding neighbors from different topics (different Field of Study / BERTopic label).

    Penalty if all neighbors are from the same topic (overfitting).

ðŸŽ¯ (Small trick): You can use topic label embeddings (from BERTopic) and maximize topic distance among neighbors.
2. Neighborhood Regularization

âœ… Regularize the node's neighborhood embedding to encourage heterogeneous neighborhoods.

    Standard GNNs aggregate neighbors equally.

    You can modify the aggregation so that different types (topics, FOS) get more weight.

ðŸŽ¯ Maybe use attention that boosts different-topic neighbors.

Example:

    If Paper A and Paper B are both GNN papers, but Paper C is about Graph Pretraining, give extra attention to C if slightly relevant.

3. Contrastive Learning with Negative Sampling

âœ… Train your KG embedding to:

    Pull semantically meaningful neighbors together.

    Push away unrelated boring ones.

BUT importantly:

    Sample hard negatives: papers that are slightly related but not identical.

ðŸŽ¯ (Trick): Use SciBERT cosine similarity to find soft negatives â€” not random, but near your domain.
4. Semantic Drift Encouragement

âœ… Design the model to allow semantic drift across hops.

    Normally embeddings want 1-hop and 2-hop neighbors to be very close.

    You allow a controlled drift â€” so that 2-hop neighbors can innovate, not stay in the same subfield.

ðŸŽ¯ You can define a semantic drift score:

    E.g., how much topic change occurs between nodes, and maximize it in some paths.
