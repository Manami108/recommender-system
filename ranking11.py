# You already have:

# - Each candidate has: paper_id, similarity_score, topic_match, writing_phase
# - Your paragraph's writing phase is known (from LLM)

# Load paper metadata

# === Scoring Weights ===

gamma = 0.3   # topic alignment
delta = 0.0   # fos diversity (optional later)
theta = 0.2   # phase match bonus

# === Phase-specific logic ===
